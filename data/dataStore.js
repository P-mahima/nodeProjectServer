Jon and Kate, who split in 2009, also famously share 19-year-old sextuplets Aaden, Collin, Joel, Hannah, Alexis and Leah.When she was 15 years old, Mady stated in a blistering comment to PEOPLE, “He doesn’t even know us… And the last thing I have time for is a toxic relationship.” Cady added at the time, “I wouldn’t even know what to say about him.” The comments come after Jon’s insistence that he wants to “rebuild” his allegedly alienated relationship with his kids. “I am relieved that court is over and I can focus on rebuilding my relationships with my children who now live in North Carolina and New York,” the personality told Us Weekly in an interview earlier this month. “It’s a very freeing feeling to not have to worry about lawsuits from Kate and really opens the door for me to reach out to my other children.

However, globally, Oppenheimer has earned $220 million, while Barbie has already crossed the $400 million mark.Prior to its release, the live-action film on the Mattel doll saw weeks of buzz, as a part of the ‘Barbenheimer’ cultural event. Fans even dressed up in pink to watch the film. However, a section of the audience has been left disappointed by the film’s treatment of serious subjects like patriarchy and sexism.

He’s an expert, he’s the artist, and he’s a genius in this area.”“Even the authors of American Prometheus say that they don’t really know if it happened.

A genre mashup that combines elements of science-fiction, satire, comedy and Blaxploitation cinema, the movie strikes a wondrous tonal balance, but the undercurrent of goofiness that runs through it is straight out of those Hanna-Barbera cartoons about a talking dog and a gang of pesky kids.Written and directed by debutant Juel Taylor, They Cloned Tyrone has been somewhat silenced amid the ‘bawaal’ of ‘Barbenheimer’ — once again highlighting the huge chasm in the cultural relevance of theatrical movies and streaming ‘content’ — but it might just be the second-best film in an unusually packed week.Attack the Block’s John Boyega stars as a drug peddler named Fontaine, who is gunned down in an early scene by a man he slighted moments earlier. That’s what running someone over with a car in a particularly rough neighbourhood gets you. Fontaine’s colourful cohort, a smooth-talking pimp named Slick Charles (played by Jamie Foxx in what might just be one of the best performances of career), witnesses the shooting. But imagine his surprise when the next day, a seemingly healthy Fontaine comes banging on his door, apparently unaware of the fact that he’d been murdered mere hours ago."

Nutritionist Lovneet Batra says “Taking care of your gut health is crucial during the monsoon season because it’s important for digestion, immunity, and general health.

        LargeContent: "Workouts are sometimes stimulation and at most times a calibrated challenge. Why do we need to challenge our body? So that it can grow in its ability, capability, efficiency and functionality. We exercise so that we can remain fit and active in our lifetime. The reason why any exercise routine seems overambitious and tedious is because we look at it from the perspective of achievement rather than as a necessary routine to remain healthy and a must-do to live well.So first of all, a slow, rhythmic and sub-maximal exercise should be the order of the day. Exercising by rule should never be a punishment, it should always be a celebration. And a celebratory exercise never takes the body to the point of exhaustion. Because if you are exhausted, there is no energy available for the next things to do in life. Exercise should help you liberate energy and not exhaust your energy.The human body is made to adjust to the demands that are made of it. Exercise challenges our bodies, and our bodies respond by growing stronger, more effective and more capable. According to the theory of progressive overload, we must gradually increase the intensity of our workouts if we want to keep progressing and growing. By continually pushing our bodies, we urge them to adapt well to the challenges of the exercises we do. Start slowly, eight to 10 reps at a time maximum, recovering in between, not overdoing to the point of pain and absolute fatigue. Panting is the key. So whenever it comes to a point of discomfort of any kind, whether physical — as in breathing and even mental tiredness — just stop."

But how do you determine if the eggs you are eating are fresh? Sounds surprising? For the longest time, people thought eggs don't go stale, and hence they bought them in dozens whenever needed. But in reality, it is exactly the opposite: eggs too have a shelf-life and go bad if kept for long. If you are someone storing eggs in your pantry for months, then stay back and go through the entire article. Here, we will explain how eggs go bad and show you some fool-proof ways to find out if they are good to be cooked.'Eggs going bad' is not something you have heard very commonly, but unfortunately, they do! Eggs store various essential nutrients, which over time, lose their potency. This condition makes it a favourable ground for the growth of microorganisms, including E. Coli, turning eggs hazardous for health. Hence, it is suggested to buy eggs in smaller batches and store them properly to avoid any kind of contamination.While some eggs come in cartons with expiry dates written on them, some are sold loose, which needs proper storage. According to food experts, you can keep eggs for seven to eight days at room temperature (but in a cool dry place). And if refrigerated well, these eggs can have a shelf-life of up to 45 days. Moreover, eggs can be kept fresh for around six months in the freezer"

        LargeContent: " A woman who recently travelled to Kolkata received a different type of hospitality than most do in the City of Joy.At the end of her week-long trip, Dilashi Hemnani wanted to give a little dinner treat to her helpful driver, Manish. So last Saturday, she decided to take him to Mocambo, one of the most popular restaurants in the city, famous for its Continental cuisine, to make good for the previous day when he'd missed lunch because she'd forgotten to tell him to go and eat while she was at a meeting.However, her kind and philanthropic gesture wasn't received too well by the restaurant staff. Hemnani described her experience through a Facebook post that has shocked many across the nation.She explains in the post how they were first told to wait for 15 minutes for a table. It was only after she enquired again after 20 minutes had passed, that the staff related to her that she won't be given a table because she was accompanied by Manish, her driver.According to the post, the staff then came up with excuses like he was not properly dressed, and because he is drunk. Hemnani contested both allegations, but finally gave up."

The lawsuit can potentially break up the tech giant into smaller parts, the report adds. FTC has been looking into the businesses of Amazon from various aspects. The lawsuit is likely to come up in August next month. If FTC wins the case, this would mean that the sprawling empire worth $1.3 trillion will be restructured. This can be the legacy-defining moment for FTC boss Lina Khan. Many see this as one of the most potent attempt by the Joe Biden administration in taming the tech giant. Khan rose to prominence after a 2017 paper that called out Amazon for being a ‘modern monopolist’. Though the details of the lawsuit are not not known, the Politico report said that FTC’s case will largely focus on Amazon’s business practices such as ‘forcing’ traders to use the company’s ad and logistics services.

It said most species were harmless to humans, but a few have a painful sting and people should not touch any jellyfish washed ashore. MCS is in its 20th year of gathering reports of jellyfish and sea turtles. It hopes to have gathered 20,000 sightings from over the two decades by the end of this year."

        LargeContent: "One of the UK's rarest birds is raising a family in Kent after escaping record temperatures further south, nature experts say. Four black-winged stilt chicks have recently fledged in Worth Marshes, near Sandwich, after a pair of the birds arrived from Africa in the spring. It is believed the species is flying further north as climate change causes its natural habitat in countries like Spain to become too hot. The wetland habitat is so incredibly important for them to breed,said Vicki Peaple, a warden for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) in Worth Marshes. The nature reserve has been especially prepared to welcome black-winged stilts, which wildlife presenter Bill Oddie named one of the worlds most elegant birds."
